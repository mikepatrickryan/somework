      <p class="blurb">Exhibit 3.0 is a publishing framework for <em>large scale</em> data-rich interactive Web pages, building on the success of the <a href="../exhibit/">original Exhibit</a>.</p>

      <p class="bodycontent">The Exhibit 3.0 software is comprised of two separate components, <strong>Scripted</strong> for building in-browser Exhibits, and <strong>Staged</strong> for server-based Exhibits.  We are currently at a <strong>beta</strong> release for both pieces: most things work, but there are bugs and the packaging is a little rough around the edges.</p>

      <h3>Staged</h3>

      <p>Our main implementation focus for Exhibit 3.0 Staged is <a href="https://github.com/zepheira/backstage/">Backstage, on GitHub</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/zepheira/backstage/issues">Bug reports</a> belong on GitHub.  You will need to build it yourself to test it out, and here is the <a href="https://github.com/zepheira/backstage/wiki/Building-backstage">documentation on how to do that</a>. You'll also find documentation on the new <a href="https://github.com/zepheira/backstage/wiki/Http-interface">HTTP interface</a>.</p>

      <h3>Scripted</h3>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/zepheira/exhibit3/">Exhibit 3.0 Scripted is on GitHub</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/zepheira/exhibit3/issues">Bug reports</a> belong on GitHub.  You can see some demos on the <a href="https://ci.zepheira.com/job/test_exhibit3/">continuous integrator</a>, along with documentation and code coverage reports.</p>

      <h2>Beta Release!</h2>

      <p>Exhibit 3.0 Beta is ready for community input.  Highlighted features included in this release:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scalability: Browse 100k items</li>
        <li>Persistence: Pick up where you left off browsing an Exhibit</li>
        <li>Bookmarks: Share exactly what you see with others</li>
        <li>jQuery: All Scripted code makes use of jQuery, resolving old browser-specific bugs</li>
        <li>Result paging, bug fixes, documentation, tests, and more</li>
      </ul>

      <p>What's still left:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding more views to both Scripted and Staged</li>
        <li>Adding more facets to both Scripted and Staged</li>
        <li>Adding more importer formats to Scripted</li>
        <li>Fixing known bugs and adding back prior features</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Zepheira will provide a hosted server environment in the future for testing the new Exhibit platform in the near future. In the meantime, you can build it yourself.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>

	  <p>Development work proceeds from the <a href="Architecture.pdf">proposed architecture (PDF)</a> plan released in early 2011.  You can also read the official <a href="Exhibit3%20press%20release.pdf">press release (PDF)</a> for background information and the <a href="Simile%20Tools%20Workshop%20Summary.pdf">workshop summary (PDF)</a> that originally defined new community requirements for Exhibit 3.0, including:</p>

      <ul class="requirements">
	   <li>Be scalable up to 1 million triples and 20,000 facet values</li>
	   <li>Provide a server-side option for publishing large collections</li>
	   <li>Include a simple way to move from small collections stored in the browser to larger collections stored on the server</li>
	   <li>Support incremental updates of views in the UI</li>
	   <li>Provide an API for result set pagination and/or summarization</li>
	   <li>Make it easier to add new views, widgets and facets to the UI</li>
	   <li>Improve embed-ability of Exhibits into external applications and Web pages</li>
	   <li>Support links to particular Exhibit states</li>
	   <li>Provide support for limited data and UI editing in the Exhibit UI via plug-ins or widgets</li>
	   <li>Provide data export features to enable large-scale data editing in external applications (e.g. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/">Google Refine</a>)</li>
	   <li>For complex UI layout editing, provide extension hooks and reference implementations as examples</li>
